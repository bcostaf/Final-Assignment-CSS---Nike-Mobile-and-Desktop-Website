        <p>The radiance lives on in the Nike Air Force 1 '07, the basketball original that puts a fresh spin on what you
            know best: durably stitched overlays, clean finishes and the perfect amount of flash to make you shine.</p>
        <h2>Air Force 1 Origins</h2>
        <p>Debuting in 1982, the AF-1 was the first basketball shoe to house Nike Air, revolutionising the game while
            rapidly gaining traction around the world. Today, the Air Force 1 stays true to its roots with the same soft
            and
            springy cushioning that changed sneaker history.
        </p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>The stitched overlays on the upper add heritage style, durability and support.
            Originally designed for performance hoops, the Nike Air cushioning adds lightweight, all-day comfort.
            The low-cut silhouette adds a clean, streamlined look.
            The padded collar feels soft and comfortable.</p>
